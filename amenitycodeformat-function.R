# this function recodes amenity features to include a year range per the data model. For example, the amenity (C) stood for coffee house from 1965-1989. It was absent from the Damron categorizations from 1990-1998. In 1999 it reappeared. But this time it meant Cabaret. This function recodes entries of C to reflect the dates for each category and to distinguish between the two meanings.
